# Dive Into Ford GoBike Data

## Project Motivation

Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the Ford GoBike dataset was collected and investigated.
Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

- How long are bikes used per ride?


- When should we deploy more bikes on the street


- The impact of bike share?



## File Description

- A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook
- A Data Exploration Jupyter notebook with TPL format
- Two Html presentaion slides
- One dataset about Ford GoBike usage csv file

## Results of the analysis
   
Ford GoBike can offer clients who rent bikes longer than 10 minutes a better offer to keep clients with little cost. In order to improve the service, Ford Gobike can deploy more bike during peak hours and abandon the less popular bike share program.
